# Onboard iPhone into Intune and Assign Compliance Policy

## Introduction

### Intune MDM (Mobile Device Management) for iPhone is a cloud-based management solution within Microsoft Intune that allows organizations to securely manage iOS devices like iPhones and iPads. It provides a way for IT administrators to control, configure, and protect company data on these devices, ensuring security and compliance without compromising the user experience.

### Intune can enforce security policies and configurations on enrolled iPhones, such as passcode requirements, Wi-Fi settings, VPNs, and email profiles.  It allows organizations to push apps or app bundles to devices from the App Store, as well as in-house built apps. The IT department can manage app permissions, enforce policies, and control updates. Intune also offers remote management options such as locking or wiping devices, resetting passcodes, and troubleshooting issues. IT can check compliance status and ensure devices adhere to company policies and posture configuration.
